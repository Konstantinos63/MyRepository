This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Step 1: I Load the data and check summary  
We load the dataset from a CSV file and view a summary of its contents to understand the variables and basic statistics.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(lmtest)
library(sandwich)
data <- read_csv("final_df.csv")
```
Step 2: I run basic regression  
I estimate a simple linear regression (reg1) where BMI is explained by whether someone is in NY (NY_dummy), the year (YEAR_dummy), and variables related to fries and health.

```{r}
summary(data)
reg1 <- lm(BMI ~ NY_dummy + YEAR_dummy + FRIESMO.y + fryoverload + HEALTH, data = data)
summary(reg1)
```
Below I perform time series analysis for BMI through the defined timeframe and for all of 6 States in my dataset.
This plot helps you visually check whether New York’s BMI trend changed after the policy compared to control states like NJ, CT, MA, PA, and FL.
```{r}
bmi_trends <- data %>%
  group_by(state, YEAR) %>%
  summarize(avg_BMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(bmi_trends, aes(x = YEAR, y = avg_BMI, color = state)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Average BMI Over Time by State",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average BMI",
       color = "State") +
  theme_minimal()
``` 
Step 3: I run Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression by adding an interaction term between NY_dummy and YEAR_dummy to check if BMI changes in NY after the policy, compared to other states.
```{r}
reg2 <- lm(BMI ~ NY_dummy * YEAR_dummy + FRIESMO.y + fryoverload + HEALTH, data = data)
summary(reg2)
```
Step 4: Calculate robust standard errors  
We use robust standard errors for reg2 to correct for possible heteroskedasticity and get more reliable p-values.
```{r}
coeftest(reg2, vcov = vcovHC(reg2, type = "HC1"))
cat("\nRegression 1 Results:\n")
print(summary(reg1))
cat("\nRegression 2 (DiD) Results:\n")
print(summary(reg2))
cat("\nRegression 2 (DiD + robust SE) Results:\n")
print(coeftest(reg2, vcov = vcovHC(reg2, type = "HC1")))
cat("\nYEAR_dummy distribution:\n")
print(table(data$YEAR_dummy))
```

Step 5: I add squared term for fryoverload  
We create a new variable fryoverload_sq (fryoverload squared) to capture possible nonlinear effects of fry consumption.
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(fryoverload_sq = fryoverload^2)
```
Step 7: I run an extended regression with quadratic term  
Basically, I estimate a new model (reg4) including fryoverload_sq, to test if the effect of fryoverload on BMI levels off or changes at higher levels.
```{r}
reg4 <- lm(BMI ~ NY_dummy * YEAR_dummy + FRIESMO.y + fryoverload + fryoverload_sq + HEALTH, data = data)
summary(reg4)
```

CONCLUSIONS/ RESULTS:

R1) In reg2 the interaction has a -0.03 reduction in the BMI of the average NYorker.p-value is very high.
The calorie labeling policy in New York does not show a statistically significant effect on BMI in this sample. The near-zero estimate and high p-value suggest no meaningful change in BMI in NY after the policy, relative to control states.

R2) Eating fries frequently is strongly and positively associated with BMI. For every unit increase in fryoverload, BMI increases by roughly 0.78–2.3 units, depending on whether we account for nonlinear effects.

Estimate ≈ 0.78 to 2.31 (depending on the model)
p-value ≈ < 0.001 (highly significant)

R3) In the quadratic model (reg4), fryoverload_sq has:
Estimate ≈ -0.037
p-value ≈ < 0.001 (highly significant)

The negative coefficient suggests diminishing returns: as fryoverload increases, the additional effect on BMI becomes smaller. In simple terms, the BMI rise slows down at very high levels of fry consumption.

THE END

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
