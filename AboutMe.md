My name is Konstantinos (or Kostas) and I am an aspiring economist with strong analytical and math skills, majoring in MSc degree in Applied Quant Economic Analysis at Dyson College of Arts and Sciences with an expected graduation date in September 2025. I am seeking a financially-driven company to develop my professional career as an analyst.

I'm mostly interested in numbers and sports and in my free time I would dive deeper into Economic Research to cultivate my skills and utilize reliable sources ( (i.e. Investopedia) to keep on track with economy news.

Former athlete in water-polo and huge fan of sports and well-being. Previously participated into National championships and Balkan tournaments and conquered the gold medal with my team in Greece.
